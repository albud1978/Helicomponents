These values on the child elements must be taken into account. • ""delete"", the element has been deleted Note The attribute changeType can apply to any element and not especially to the element where the change occurs. Depending on the type of the change, propagation rules defining the change marking inheritance from the upper element to the lower may differ: - Elements marked with the value “modify” are allowed to contain elements marked with values “add”, “modify” or “delete” - Elements marked with the value “delete”: There is no need to set the change attributes on the element’s children because this is implied. Any change markings on child elements are ignored by the presentation system. - Elements marked with value “add”: There is no need to set the change attributes on the element’s children because this is implied. Any change markings on child elements are ignored by the presentation system. Note: If this attribute is not used, and the attribute changeMark is used, the change is assumed to be an addition."
